# git-it-done

This module project, "Git-it-done, is an app that can be used by developers who want to contribute to open source projects, but are having trouble finding them. This web app will search GitHub for open source projects with open issues and pull requests." Users of the app can search either by typing a username into the searchbar, or by clicking on one of the button topics. Git-it-done will then display repositories that match the search, as well as the number of open issues they have. Users can click on individual repo names to open a page which provides clarification of the issue (issue vs. pull_request), as well as links the issues on Github directly. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Uses the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest); a RESTFul server-side API that provides URLs, or endpoints, where a developer can make requests for GitHub user and repository data to use in their own application.
